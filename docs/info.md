## Background
Tracking the allocation of items such as room keys, workstations, and space has been a pain-point for many years. The central systems often donâ€™t track these items or provide easy access. There is no unified tool to look at everything that must be tracked during typical business use. KEAS is not a generalized case management system like AggieService, but rather a specialized tool to for tracking or allotment of keys, equipment, access, or space.

IET developed an in-house system to handle these business needs. However, this original system has proven to be difficult to scale up to the campus at-large. The project goal is to develop a system that incorporates the business logic of its precursor on an easily scalable and extensible platform. Core team has track record of delivering secure, scalable, maintainable, and extensible systems.

## Objectives
* Provide new capabilities to efficiently plan allocation of keys, equipment, access, and space .
* Unify the disparate central campus systems which track one particular aspect into an integrated business tool
aligned with the general workflow of departments. Integrate with UCPath N-Tier data where useful.
* Provide easy visibility and reporting of Key/Equipment/Access/Space allocations.
* Provide secure, efficient, reliable service at no-cost to departments to enable widespread use and adoption
regardless of budget priorities.

## Scope
The KEAS project is being undertaken to provide a modern, mobile-friendly, cloud-based tracking system to handle the specific needs of campus business units around tracking Keys, Equipment, Access, and Space. It supplements more
generalized Case Management systems like AggieService by providing a specific tool
to handle these specific cases.
